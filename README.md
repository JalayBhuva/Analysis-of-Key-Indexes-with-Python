# Analysis-of-Key-Indexes-with-Python
## A. Objective
In this data analytics project, I delved into global indices to uncover factors influencing quality of life across countries. With help of Python and its tools like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized data, navigating complexities to reveal patterns. The project aimed to illuminate connections between indices, providing insights on global quality of life.

## B. Problem Statement
To identify the factors influencing or affecting the quality of life in diverse countries.

## C. Tools
Primary: Python 

Secondary: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and NumPY

## D. Problem faced?
Data Cleaning: Addressing missing or inconsistent data and ensuring data quality for accurate analysis. Analyzing Global indexes of different countries to have a better view on Standard of living and other factors as well. 

## E. Solution
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Thoroughly cleaning the data with precise methods to manage missing values and guarantee the accuracy of the information.

Visualization: Utilizing charts and graphs to visually depict data on video views, genre preferences, popularity of platforms and ect.

## F. Insights
The project uncovered valuable insights into the factors that affect the quality of life in various countries. Whether examining the relationship between purchasing power and property prices or grasping the influence of pollution on the overall well-being index, the analysis offered a comprehensive perspective on the global scenario.

## G. Project Duration: 1.5 Week
